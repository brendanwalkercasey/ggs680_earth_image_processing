A fundamental responsibility for remote sensing scientists is processing satellite and aerial imagery. However, costs associated with time, materials, and manpower often restrict resources. Methods for semi-automated and automated feature extraction, such as edge detection, simplify the analysis of imagery through reduction of extraneous variables that would otherwise heavily deplete valuable resources and production costs. While several types of edge detection methods have been introduced in the last several decades, the Canny Edge Detector is generally considered the most effective method. Features will often exhibit multiple types of edges, creating the need to detect both linear and curvilinear features. Using an edge detector (such as the Canny Edge Detector), the Hough Transform can be applied to an edge image to extract features of a variety of proportions.
